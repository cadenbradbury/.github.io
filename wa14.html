	<h1> WA 14 </h1>
	<p>Over the course of this class, I have gained knowledge in a variety of tools to share information and data with others. Here are some of the tools I would use to present TV data to different audiences:</p>
	<p>	The most obvious audience for my article written about How To with John Wilson is other HBO users. These people would be interested in discovering new shows to watch. To cater towards these people, I would use Bootstraps. Bootstraps would allow me to make a very clean website displaying my opinion on How To with John Wilson. It has a lot of preset styles, fonts, themes, etc, so it would be fairly simple to make my opinions about the show look clean. I could also create helpful links to HBO, reviews, and data about How To with John Wilson. This method would be the best way to communicate my thoughts with a large audience of devoted show watchers.</p>
	<p>	Since How To with John Wilson ended at the start of COVID, COVID data would be great to use. I could show the timeframe of the show aside the cases in New York City, because it was filmed there. To do this, I would present to data scientists through Jupyter Notebooks. This allows other data scientists to see the manipulations I made to the data. A Jupyter Notebook may be hard for the public to understand, but by showing data scientists my raw code, they could fully understand my methods. They could then ask questions, challenge my ideas, and, most importantly, provide suggestions on how to improve my work. Since Jupyter Notebooks allows for easy and clear documentation, this would make my unorganized code look presentable. </p>
	<p>	I may like to present my TV data to a group that studies how documentaries interact with their environment. Since How To with John Wilson is filmed like a documentary, I feel that it applies here. This group would be a mix of sociologists and data scientists. To present to them, I could use Reveal.js. This would allow me to make clear, visually appealing slides and highlight some technical aspects. Reveal.js makes it simple to show visualizations and explain them in a slide show format, so I would make my findings very clear for non programmers. I could then add more explanation about my code with nested sections. This would allow for most users to scroll through my findings and visualizations easily, but if they want to see more about my code, they could scroll down. </p>
