<h1>How To with John Wilson: The perfect people watching show </h1>

<p>I recently obtained my parents HBO Max password, opening me up to a whole new plethora of content to watch. One of my favorite new shows I found is called How To with John Wilson. In this eight episode series, John Wilson films his experiences living in New York City. The footage shows the bizarre, and often hilarious, scene of New York City in its truest form. How To may not have received the national attention other series on HBO have obtained, but I think it stands with some of the best series I’ve seen. <p>

<p> John Wilson, the mastermind behind the show, delivers comedy in a refreshing style that puts his subjects in the spotlight of the show. We often hear John interacting with people off the street, but always from behind the camera. This can be off putting to viewers at first, but this format allows fans of the series to meet the most interesting people in New York. This style of comedy is similar to walking down the street and people watching.<p>

<p>How To also comes from the studio that produced Nathan For You, another of my personal favorites. Nathan For You created a cult following for those that liked awkward humor that takes place in the real world. Sadly, it ended a couple years ago suddenly. The introduction of How To filled this comedic hole in my life. For fans of Nathan For You, I couldn’t recommend How To more, as it has you cracking up at fascinating people on the streets of New York City.<p>

<p>This show is especially relevant now because it was filmed right before COVID became relevant in the US. The first 7 episodes from typical New York life, but the last episode shows the initial shock COVID had on the city. New York was one of the first places struck by COVID, so this documentation is revelying. It seems like we see the biggest jump in cases from March to April, right when the last episode takes place. Total cases increased by 1,361%. I found this by manipulating a dataset on Kaggle, created by The New York Times. The dataset had COVID cases and deaths by county and state. Below is a graph generated using data from the whole state of New York made in Tableau. <p>

<p> The further we get from pre-COVID times, the more important it is to look back on these events and reflect. How To allow me to reminisce about the times we could go out to dinner with friends and meet new people. I realize that I took this time for granted, so now it’s important to savor each moment. John Wilson savors each moment by documenting them with his camera, which I don’t plan on doing. However, I do think there is something to learn from John’s obsessive behavior to not let the moment pass.<p>
